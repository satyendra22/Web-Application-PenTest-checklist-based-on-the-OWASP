## Authentication
Authentication requires proper security testing to ensure that malicious attackers have no chance to gain access to the application. For instance, if you don’t test for default or auto-generated credentials, you may miss a vulnerability due to passwords and logins (for example, logins of the format firstname.lastname) that can be guessed by tools used by attackers and lead to unauthorized access.

## Authorization
Authorization usually comes right after successful authentication, and the tester will verify this after he holds valid credentials associated with a well-defined set of roles and privileges.The main goal here is to get a comprehensive understanding of how the authorization mechanism works and to see whether it’s possible to trick it.

## Session management
Session management is one of the core components of any web application, as it covers everything from the moment users authenticate until they log out.Making sure that a session management schema can’t be bypassed is the first step of proper security testing for session management. Your goal is to trick an application to give you access to a user account without providing the correct credentials. 

## Data validation
Failure to properly validate input data that comes from the client or from the environment before using this data is a common weakness of web applications. It’s associated with many major vulnerabilities including SQL injections, file system attacks, and interpreter injections.

## Error handling
Error handling is crucial for proper web application performance and security. It can allow information disclosure thanks to informative error messages and stack traces.

## Cryptography
Cryptography is vital for web applications. The absence of encryption when transferring data between a client and a server makes it possible for hackers to arrange MITM attacks.

## Business logic
Even though business logic attacks aren’t new, they’re often underestimated, so it’s best to add business logic to your PenTest testing checklist.
Business logic vulnerabilities are unique to each application, potentially damaging, and can only be tested manually. You have to start thinking out of the box in order to find business logic weaknesses in multi-functional web applications.

## Client-side testing
This testing aims to check for correct code execution on the client side, which is distinct from the server side, as the client side returns the subsequent content. Client-side testing is typically performed natively within a web browser or browser plugin.
